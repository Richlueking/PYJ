                                    <p>The Criminal Justice program at the PYJ Polytechnic University College will make graduates highly competitive for careers in Law enforcement, corrections, private sector, and other related criminal justice fields.
                                        The criminal justice program at PYJPUC educates students for the many professions in the criminal justice and private sector security career fields. The program focuses on both classroom learning and direct experience to make our students especially marketable when they enter the workforce. According to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Liberia, “The safety and wellbeing of our Nation’s citizens greatly depends on the police officers, detectives, and special agents responsible for enforcing statutes, laws, and regulations. Duties vary widely by the size and type of organization but in most jurisdictions, whether on or off duty, law enforcement officers are expected to exercise their authority whenever necessary. And regardless of where they work or what they do (in the public or private sector), criminal justice professionals must spend considerable time writing reports and maintaining records that are needed when legal actions require them to testify in court.”
